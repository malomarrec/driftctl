### Global flags

#### Version check

By default, driftctl checks for a new version remotely. To disable this behavior, use either the flag `--no-version-check` or the environment variable `DCTL_NO_VERSION_CHECK=true`.

#### Error reporting

When a crash occurs in driftctl, we do not send any crash reports.
For debugging purposes, you can add `--error-reporting` when running driftctl and crash data will be sent to us via [Sentry](https://sentry.io)
Details of reported data can be found [here](./cmd/flags/error-reporting.md)
